The [KAD manuscript](10.1093/nargab/lqaa075) was published at NAR GAB, which uses k-mer profiling to effectively identify and locate base errors of genome assemblies. The KAD package can be found on Github. Use & feedback is appreciated.

Guifang Lin passed her preliminary exam on 4/8/2020. This is an important step toward her PhD. Congratulations!

We identified and verified two maize glossy genes with the information of gene co-expression networks. The [manuscript](10.1111/tpj.14140) was accepted by the Plant Journal.

We are honored to receive the NSF PGRP award to work on maize transformation. Here is [news](https://www.k-state.edu/today/announcement/?id=43475) from K-State.

[New manuscript](10.1093/molbev/msy174) with Schnable labs in Molecular Biology and Evolution: Intragenic Meiotic Crossovers Generate Novel Alleles with Transgressive Expression Levels.

[Exciting News](https://www.k-state.edu/today/announcement/?id=43466): NIFA is funding, through NSF/NIFA Plant Biotic Interactions Program, our 3-year project to genetically dissect bacterial virulence and host resistance of maize Goss’s wilt.
