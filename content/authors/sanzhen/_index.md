Welcome to Liu lab at the [Department of Plant Pathology](https://www.plantpath.k-state.edu/) at [Kansas State University](http://ksu.edu). Our lab primarily utilizes next generation sequencing technologies and computational tools to address biological questions of interest. Our research is focused on plant embryogenesis / regeneration, plant / microbial genomics, plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our current interests include the utility of multiple cutting-edge technologies for genome assemblies, methodologies in efficient gene mapping and cloning, understanding plant responses at the molecular level to biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g. Goss's wilt, drought condition), identification of critical genes involved in embryogenesis / regeneration and resistance genes to various pathogens in maize and wheat, as well as genomic dynamics of fungi causing blast diseases. Our lab is currently supported by the NSF Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP), the NSF/NIFA Plant Biotic Interactions (PBI),  Kansas Wheat Commission, and a few other other programs from both the NSF and USDA.
